> *“A group or network of machines that are controlled by an attacker to do a certain task”*  

### 🔍 Breaking it down with page context
- This is part of the **General Information** category, designed as a basic riddle‑style cybersecurity question.  
- The description matches the definition of a **botnet**.  
- **Botnet** = a collection of compromised computers (often called *bots* or *zombies*) that are remotely controlled by an attacker.  
- Attackers use botnets to perform coordinated tasks such as:  
  - Launching **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks  
  - Sending **spam emails**  
  - Spreading **malware**  
  - Performing **credential stuffing** or other automated abuse  

### ✅ Correct Answer Format
Since CyberTalents challenges usually require a single word without spaces, the expected answer is:  
**`Botnet`**

Would you like me to also expand on **how botnets are built and controlled** (e.g., via command‑and‑control servers), so you can see the investigative workflow behind this clue?
